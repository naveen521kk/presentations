          <h3>What is Git?</h3>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            Git is a <em>distributed</em> version control system that allows you
            to track changes to files and collaborate with others.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Ask about what's a version control system (VCS) and why it's useful.

          <h3>What is a version control system (VCS)?</h3>
          <p class="fragment fade-in">
            A version control system is a tool that allows you to track changes
            to files and collaborate with others.
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">
            Go ahead and tell about creating various versions of a file and
            keeping track of them. Tell about how it's useful to have a system
            that tracks changes to our project files over time.

            <h3>Setup Instructions</h3>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              Git is available on most operating systems. You can download it
              from
              <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">git-scm.com/downloads</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              You can also install it using a package manager, if you are using
              one. For example, on Ubuntu:
            </p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              <code>sudo apt install git</code>
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">Ask people to install it side by side.</aside>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>Checking install</h3>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              You can check if git is installed by running the following command
              in your terminal:
            </p>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              <code>git --version</code>
            </p>
            <img
              src="assets/git-version-command.png"

          <section>
            <h3>Configuring Git</h3>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              Git needs to know who you are before you can start using it. You
              can configure your name and email address using the following
              commands:
            </p>
            <pre class="fragment fade-in bash">
              <code data-trim data-noescape>
                $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
                $ git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
            </code>
            </pre>
            <img
              src="assets/git-config-name-email.png"
              class="fragment fade-in"
            />
            <aside class="notes">
              create account for people who don't have one.
              Ask people to configure their name and email address. Tell them
              that this is important because git will use this information to
              track who made changes to the files.

            <h3>Repositories</h3>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              A Git repository is a container for a project that is tracked by
              Git. Treat it like a folder that contains all the files for your
              project and a hidden folder that contains all the information
              about the project.
            </p>
            <aside class="notes">
              Tell about how git stores all the information about your project
              in a hidden folder called .git. Tell about how git stores all the
              files for your project in the folder that you are currently in.

            <h3>Types of Repositories</h3>
            <p class="fragment fade-in">
              There are two types of repositories:
            </p>
            <ul class="fragment fade-in">
              <li>Local</li>
              <li>Remote</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              Tell about local repositories and how they are stored on your
              computer. Tell about remote repositories and how they are stored
              on a remote server.

            to use:
